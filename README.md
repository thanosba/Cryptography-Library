# Cryptography-Library
Cryptography is an actively developed library that provides cryptographic recipes and primitives. It supports Python 2.6-2.7, Python 3.3+ and PyPy.  Cryptography is divided into two layers of recipes and hazardous materials (hazmat). The recipes layer provides simple API for proper symmetric encryption and the hazmat layer provides low-level cryptographic primitives.
